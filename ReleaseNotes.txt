1.1.0 (08/30/2009)
* Implemented operator == for all element types
* Added makefile for building with g++ (thanks George Morgan).
* Fixed a few compiler errors on non-Visual Studio compilers (my C++ wasn't as ANSI as I thought...)
* Support for (non-standard) comments REMOVED
* Support for Visual Studio 7.1 (2003) REMOVED
* Fixed the "Unexpected token..." exception string (was gibberish)
* Improvements to the QuickInterpreter & QuickBuilder interfaces
* Elements now sanity-check themselves during operations and throw an exception accordingly, for example if an Object gets tricked into thinking it's an Array (reinterpret_cast, reading a document with an Array root element into an Object, etc)
* Other random minor bug fixes & general cleanup

1.0.0 (01/31/2009)
* Initial release! Remaining work: better documentation, better test/sample app, yada yada
